<h1>⭐ Word Adventure</h1>
<div class="badge">Privacy Policy</div>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>Word Adventure ("we", "our", or "the app") is a children's educational spelling and reading app. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all users, especially children. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and your rights.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Word Adventure does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No account or registration required</strong> — the app works without signing in.</li>
  <li><strong>No personal data collected</strong> — we do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personally identifiable information.</li>
  <li><strong>No location data</strong> — the app does not access or use your device's location.</li>
  <li><strong>No analytics or tracking</strong> — we do not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools.</li>
  <li><strong>No data sent to servers</strong> — the app functions entirely offline. No data ever leaves your device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Microphone Access</h2>
<p>The app requests access to your device's microphone <strong>only</strong> to enable the optional Spelling Quiz voice input feature. When a child speaks their answer, the audio is processed locally on the device by the operating system's built-in speech recognition service. <strong>We do not record, store, or transmit any audio data.</strong></p>
<p>Microphone access is optional. The app works fully without granting microphone permission.</p>

<h2>3. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
<p>The app stores the following information locally on your device only, using browser localStorage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Star count (progress score)</li>
  <li>Words marked as "Learnt"</li>
  <li>Words seen / progress tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>This data never leaves your device and can be cleared at any time by clearing the app's data in your device settings.</p>

<h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Word Adventure is designed for children aged 3–12. We take children's privacy seriously and comply with applicable laws including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</li>
  <li>No in-app advertising is shown to users.</li>
  <li>No social features, chat, or user-generated content sharing is available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Word Adventure does not integrate any third-party advertising networks, analytics platforms, or social media SDKs. The only external service used is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Play</strong> — for app distribution and in-app purchases (where applicable). Google's privacy policy applies to their services: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
  <li><strong>Device speech recognition</strong> — when voice input is used, the operating system's built-in speech recognition may process audio according to your device manufacturer's privacy policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>The app may offer optional in-app purchases to unlock additional word packs. All purchases are handled securely by Google Play. We do not collect or store any payment or financial information.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
